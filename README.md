# Number-Guessing-Game-TS

This Node.js application is a simple number guessing game. The user tries to guess a number between 1 and 10 that is randomly generated by the system. It uses the `inquirer` package for user input and provides feedback based on the user's guess.

## Features

- **Number Guessing**: The user inputs a guess and the application checks if it matches a randomly generated number.
- **Feedback**: Provides feedback to the user based on whether the guess is correct or not.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/number-guessing-game.git
   cd number-guessing-game
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed. Then run:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Game:**

   Execute the script using Node.js:

   ```bash
   node game.js
   ```

2. **Provide Input:**

   The application will prompt you to guess a number between 1 and 10. It will then check your guess against the randomly generated number and provide feedback.

## Code Overview

- **Random Number Generation:**

  ```typescript
  const systemGeneratedNo = Math.random() * 10;
  ```

  Generates a random number between 0 and 10.

- **User Input:**

  ```typescript
  const answers: ansType = await inquirer.prompt([
    {
      type: "number",
      name: "userGuess",
      message: "Write your guess b/w 1 to 10: ",
    },
  ]);
  ```

  Prompts the user to enter a number between 1 and 10.

- **Comparison and Feedback:**

  ```typescript
  if (userGuess === systemGeneratedNo) {
    console.log("Yeah your answer is correct \n You Win! ");
  } else {
    console.log("Please try again better luck next time!");
  }
  ```

  Compares the user's guess with the randomly generated number and provides appropriate feedback.

## Example

**Sample Interaction:**

```bash
Write your guess b/w 1 to 10: 5
```

**Output:**

```
5 userGuess 3.754 sYs
Please try again better luck next time!
```

## Error Handling

The application assumes the user will input a number. If the input is not a number, `inquirer` will handle it according to its default behavior.
